# Kannan_SVP
Kannan methods for enumerating shortest vector (short(est) vector problem, SVP) in Lattice with norm less than some radius,  [solution, comb, normsolution]  = KFP2( A,norma2 ). Add different lattice reduction (LLL,KZ/HKZ,Seysen,Brun - solve short(est) basis problems, SBP) for preprocessing Lattice for speed-up method. Base algorithm for Sphere Decoder (MIMO, QR-MLD, Lattice Aided), ECC decoding (Closes Vector Problem), Hamming distance estimation, Post Quantum Crytography cryptoanalysis (before LWE-problems, not trivial to directly applied to solve non-binary and non-ternary cases).
